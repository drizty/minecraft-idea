==============

hey gais read plox - 
this was more for me to keep track of everything but decided to write it all down in case you feel
like reading. WOW I WROTE A LOT SORRY!!! - BUT IT IS A GOOD READ!

had a cool idea with minecraft if you where all interested!

the idea was that we would have our own set class ( kinda like rping without the faggitory )
each person would have their own mods that only they were able to use
meaning me as a witch would be unable to build a macerator, or use equilvent exchange


yes some the classes at the moment are slightly 'unbalanced' but i'll explain in a bit.


the idea was that this would almost produce player economy eg.
i collect copper ore, but have no use for it, tyno collected an air shard - we can trade reasources this does 2 things
- gives us a reason to build travel to each others base
- allows team work / team progression while still have our own base!

there is also mods that require other mods to work efficiently heres some examples

Bens portals require power to work - tyno can provide this power easily and efficiently early on
1. so maybe tyno just wants coal as payment - to cover the costs of fuel
2. or maybe he wants bones / string as ben will have easy access to mob farms with soul shards mod
3. or ben could hide a lifesiphon under james's base with blood magic to power it 
( it would be obvious but kudos for trying! you shifty fuck! :P )

every player can self power and operate everything within their mods 
( except a very minor select few mods ) without others help!, 
just simply tyno will produce power more easily and earlier then ben or myself


the only problem at the moment is that me or ben could not offer as much as what tyno could offer to us
my idea was to make food easily avaliable to us, but we all know how easy food is when you find 2 animals... 
( have babys you little shits!!! )
Ben would have EE3 which he could offer his services for early on, i could offer early enchanting, 
but enchanting is something i dont want to limit me to ( as it feels very 'mage' like as well )
- in saying this tho with Tinkers construct i doubt ben would even want to use enchanting


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
this would be a custom mod pack like last time, i know i said i wouldnt do this, 
but manageing 40-50 mods is abit different to manageing 263+ mods.

This also means small downloads :)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLASSES - 
( i only suggested these classes for you guys based on what i think you enjoy
there will only be 3 of us most likely so what ever classes arnt chosen; their mods MAY be implemented into other classes
eg. atomic science / buildcraft given to engineer if no one wants the industrial class )



------The Witch------ ME

I went for a very hard gameplay style with a stone age/chemist feel : 
1. no fast mining tools, 
2. no fast production,
3. no mass farming until late game
my intention was to play this single player but i would of course prefer to play with you guys
hence all of this shiz

THE MODS:
thaumcraft
magic crops
enchanting plus
Project Red: Base
rail craft (everyone)
barrels

------The Mage------ BEN???

tried to focus on ben for this one
the idea was a mix 
1. long progression / extreme tech tree ( ars magika  )
2. Magic feel
3. Ease of gameplay ( EE3 + tinkers ) - no greg tech :P
the feel was a medieval / magic setting, ben likes to hide in a tree like an elf faggot
i felt these mods would benefit this... you fking hippy

THE MODS:
ars magika
blood magic
EE3
The Twilight Forest
EnhancedPortals 3
tinkers construct
Project Red: All
Soul Shards 2
totemic!!
rail craft (everyone)
iron chests 

------The Engineer------ Trolyno???

focused on tyno for this class
has both ease and average tech tree, 
the idea was to focus more on machine optimisation rather then constant tech upgrades
1. some crazy complex mods (minechem)
2. some wtf spastic mods (mad science)
3. late game tech (portal gun/ applied energistics)
4. Ease mining (turtles + quarrys)


THE MODS
engineers toolbox
Gascraft
minechem
liquid xp
Mad Science ( bio / genetic mod )
modular powersuits
turtle powaaa! - computer craft
portal gun
Project Red: All
rail craft (everyone)
applied energistics
tinkers construct
iron chests
Gravity Gun
TF2 Sentry
TF2 teleporter
TF2 dispenser


------The indsutrial man------

optional class - 
went for a semi base building theme with industry 
building a base with large factories / reactors
defending with walls / turrents
and travel to the moon for building a moon base!

THE MODS
galatic
Atomic Science
buildcraft
IC2
 - greg (only if player wants!)
minechem
calclavia (MFFS + nuclear missiles + turrets)
Project Red: All
+ ALOT OF OTHERS

------sky block hero------

just in case someone wanted this!
you start in the sky with 2 saplings and 25 pieces of dirt
you dont even get a bucket!
EXTREME BRUTAL TECH TREE!, these arnt hard just time consumeing mods

Ex Aliquo
Ex Nihilo
+ would contain alot more mods if someone was interested


------The Farmer------

We have all dabbled in it!, but can you make a fully operational base based on nature alone?
grow craft adds 10000's of different foods
we all know what bees do :)
 - the added bee genetic mod just add a larger progression
forestry - tree breeding!

i just though this would be a fun kinda pack to play - very relaxed, easy progression, and cheap builds 
(well most items are cheap!)

would be able to sell the special woods to other players!

THE MODS
Bees
 - gendustry ( bee genetic mods )
forestry
growcraft
Agriculture

------Unsure------

minefactory
ender IO
Thermal Expansion
